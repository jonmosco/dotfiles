Overview
========

Home for my (Jon) dotfiles and environment configuration

## Motivation

Consistency.

## Dependencies

Mac OSX:
* iTerm2
* Homebrew
* Stow

Linux:
* Alacritty
* i3/Sway
* Stow

## Installation

* Checkout the git repo
  NOTE: From the Advanced Bash Scripting guide:
  Caution: invoking a Bash script by sh scriptname turns off Bash-specific
  extensions, and the script may therefore fail to execute.
* run the Makefile.  The default target will provide all the necessary components
* Logout and log back in (or . .bashrc)
* open vim, and run :VundleInstall to install the plugins

Enjoy (or criticize) !
